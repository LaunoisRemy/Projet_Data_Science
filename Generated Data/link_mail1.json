A short blurb on the issue follows. Ray Ridgewood Power submitted a Request for Emergency Relief and an Updated Request for Emergency Relief requesting the Commission to take action to prevent QF capacity from going off- line in the State of California. Ridgewood asks the Commission to take actions that will permit those QFs in California that have not been paid fully for past power deliveries to enter arrangements to temporarily sell to third-party buyers within California. Ridgewood asks the Commission to declare that California electric utilities cannot deny transmission access to QFs or otherwise frustrate the ability of QFs to sell to third-party purchasers. The California Cogeneration Council filed a Motion for Emergency Relief requesting the Commission to take action to prevent QFs from going off-line in California. The Cogeneration Council requests the Commission to require interconnection, transmission, and related services under section 210(d) of the Federal Power Act on a temporary basis pending the resolution of accounts receivable issues. The Commission is also instituting a proceeding in which it will consider whether and to what extent it may need to order the provision of interconnection, transmission, and related services under Section 210(d) to alleviate generation capacity supply shortages in California.
